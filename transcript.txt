00:00:00 call Whitney the only living things in the entire universe the observable universe is about 19 billion light years and diamonds are there are at least 100 billion galaxies each with 100 to 1,000 billion stars recently we've learned that it's very coming to and then I'll probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist rice but where is it 
00:00:30 the universe be teaming with spaceships let's take a step back even if there are alien civilizations in other galaxies there's no way we'll ever know about the basically everything outside of on Direct Galactic neighborhood local group pretty much as well Rich forever because of the expansion of the universe even if we had ready from space 
00:01:00 it would literally take billions of years to reach these places traveling through the emptiest areas in the universe so let's focus on the Milky Way the Milky Way is our galaxy it consists of up to 400 billion stars that's a lot of stars roughly 10,000 for every grain of sand on earth there are about 20 billion sun-like stars in the Milky Way and estimates suggest a defensive end in Spanish 
00:01:30 the area with conditions that enable life to exist if only 0.1% of those pallets Hubbard life that would be 1 million pallets with life in the Milky Way but wait there's more the Milky Way is about 13 billion years old in the beginning it would not have been a good place for life because of things exploded lost but I'm still want to 2 billion years the first habitable planets what board is only 14 years old so that have probably been trillions of chances for 
00:02:00 ways to develop on other planets in the past if only a single one of them had developed into a space traveling super civilization we would have noticed by now what would such a civilization look like they're all free cash Grace a type 1 civilization would be able to access the whole energy available in Spanish in case you're wondering where currently around 0.73 on the scale and we should reach type one sometime in the next couple of hundred years type 2 would be a civilization 
00:02:30 capable of harnessing all of the energy of its atoms. This would require some serious science fiction but it is doable in principle Concepts like the dysons fit a giant complex surrounding the sun would be considerable time 3 is a civilization the Bay City controls its whole galaxy and its energy an alien race this Advanced would probably be good like to us but why should we be able to see such an alien civilization in the first place if we were to build a generation 
00:03:00 the could sustain the population for around 1,000 years we could colonize the whole galaxy in 2 million years sounds like a long time but remember the Milky Way is huge so if it takes a couple of million years to colonize the entire galaxy and there are possibly Millions if not billions of Planets versus a knife in the Milky Way and these out of my phones I've had considerably more time to wait then we're all the aliens this is the family 
00:03:30 and nobody has knots to it but we do have some ideas let's talk about filters that filter in this context represents a barrier that is really hard for life to over, they come in various degrees of scary one that great filters and we have punched them maybe it is way harder for complex life to develop the we think the process allowed in life to begin hasn't yet been completely figured out and the conditions required 
00:04:00 pretty complicated maybe in the past the universe was way more hostile and only reason they have things cool down to make complex life possible this would also mean that we may be unique or at least one of the first if not the first civilization in the entire universe to that all grade filters and they are ahead of us this one would be ready ready bad baby life and I level exist everywhere need of us but it gets destroyed when it reaches a certain point 
00:04:30 what lies ahead of us printable awesome future technology exists but when I activate it destroys the planets the last words of every Advanced civilization would be this need to find this will solve all my problems once I push this button if this is true then we are closer to the end then the beginning of human existence or maybe that is an ancient type 3 civilization as the universe and 1 civilization is Advanced enough it gets eliminated 
00:05:00 maybe there is something out that but it would be best not to discover there is no way for us to know what if I can maybe we're alone right now we have no evidence that there's any life besides out nothing the universe appears to be empty and that no one sending those messages no one answering our calls we may be completely alone trap to voice my boy in the tunnel Universe does not feel scare you 
00:05:30 you'll have the correct emotional reaction if we let life on this planet. Raps that will be no life left in the universe life will be gone baby forever if this is the case we just have to venture to the stars become the first type 3 civilization to keep the delicate famous life existing and to spread his until the universe breeds its final breath and vanishes into Oblivion the universe is too beautiful not to be experienced by someone this video was made
